## WARNING!

The "b1" version is an unfinished update, in which it is impossible to change the user settings, autostart, and time zone in the Settings application. If you don't need it, then you can safely upgrade, but I advise you to do a clean installation.
The reason for stopping development is the need for a complete rewrite of the kernel and applications.

## Moving to Beta

FOS is entering the beta stage, because only in one update there were many changes under the hood and outside.

## About system
